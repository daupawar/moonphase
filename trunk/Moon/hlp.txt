MoonPhase shows the current moon phase and the dates of all new/full moon phases for a given year.\nTo change the current date, use the calendar control on the main screen.\nThe percentage value represents the illuminated fraction of the Moon\'s disc as a value from -99.9 to +99.9. The value is negative when the Moon wanes, and positive otherwise.\nThe New Moon phase is around 0% and the Full Moon phase is around the +/-99%.\nMoonPhase uses portions of code from the John Walker\'s MoonTool application, the Stellafane Moon Phase Calculator by by Ken Slater, and the MoonCalculator by Angus McIntyre.\nThis program is free software.\nCreated by xhuman.
