MoonPhase shows the current moon phase and the dates of all new/full moon phases for a given year.
To change the current date, use the calendar control on the main screen.
The percentage value represents the illuminated fraction of the Moon's disc as a value from -99.9 to +99.9. The value is negative when the Moon wanes, and positive otherwise.
The New Moon phase is around 0% and the Full Moon phase is around the +/-99%.
MoonPhase uses portions of code from the John Walker's MoonTool application, the Stellafane Moon Phase Calculator by by Ken Slater, and the MoonCalculator by Angus McIntyre.
